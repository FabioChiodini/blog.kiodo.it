## Welcome to my blog

My name is **Fabio Chiodini**, I am a passionate IT geek based in Italy.

I started this blog to share some tips and my perspective on the IT World.

I have an extensive experience in Tech stuff but my passion has brought me in the fields of **Tech/Portfolio Marketing/Messaging and Tech enablement**.

I started my career in Operations and IT infrastructure but in the last Years I have matured an experience around Containers, DevOps, Container orchestrators and Platform as a Service.

Understanding new concepts and methodologies and then unpacking them in an easy way is my **passion**.

I have been a **speaker** in many major conferences and when I am not meeting Customers I love to stay on stage presenting net new concepts or exploring them with demos of my own.

In essence this blog is another way of enabling people on new topics and hopefully helping them out in adopting **new methodologies** as well as new technologies.

Of course **feedback is welcomed** so don't hesitate to reach out to me on Twitter @FabioChiodini.
