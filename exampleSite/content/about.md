## Welcome to my blog

My name is Fabio Chiodini, I am a passionate IT geek based in Italy.

I started this blog to share some tips and my perspective on the IT World.

I have an extensive experience in Tech stuff but my passion has brought me in the fields of **Tech/Portfolio Marketing and Tech enablement**.

In essence this blog is another way of enabling people on new topics and hopefully helping them out in adopting **new methodologies** as well as new technologies.

Of course **feedback is welcomed** so don't hesitate to reach out to me on Twitter @FabioChiodini.
