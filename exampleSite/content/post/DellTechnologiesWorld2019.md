# What's up?

Dell Technologies World 2019 is up. I am furiously getting ready with contents for my two sessions and I am late than ever :P

# MY Sessions

Three sessions on my plate this year. Here they are without further ado ;)

**Security In A Cloud Native World: Going Faster To Be More Secure**

In the Digital Future, organizations implement Cloud Native Architectures more than ever. These architectures can pose new security problems, but also offer effective approaches to security. In this session we will provide an overview on the challenges and best security practices that you can employ in a Cloud Native environment.  

**Wednesday**, May 1, 8:30 AM - 9:30 AM

**Infrastructure Design For Kubernetes** 

Kubernetes is all the rage, and there are a ton of tools to deploy it. There are installers, cloud managed setups, full distributions like PKS, etc. But there’s always the question - beyond the software aspect, what do I need to build and provide for a successful container orchestration environment? Host types? What about storage? Networking? Load balancing? Attendees of this session will walk away with and understanding of the considerations in choosing compute platforms to run containers, along with storage systems (what is CSI anyways?), networking and load balancing. Think of this as ‘K8S for infrastructure folks’

**Tuesday**, Apr 30, 1:30 PM - 2:30 PM – Murano 3205

**Thursday**, May 2, 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM – Lando 4205

**Kubernetes: Addressing The Real World Challenges**

Abstract

Kubernetes is one of the fastest growing open source technologies, but real world production usage has yet to catch up with the hype. In this panel discussion we'll examine what the role of Kubernetes should be as part of your Application Transformation strategy, explore some of the challenges to consider when deploying it in the real world and share best practices for how to overcome those challenges. You'll leave this session armed with the practical knowledge you need to see through the Kubernetes hype and understand the limitations so you can safely deploy it in production.
