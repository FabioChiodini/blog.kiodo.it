# I'm Pivot-ing!!

## TLDR version ;)

Today I am leaving Dell Technologies to join Pivotal

## Longer version

> “Every new beginning comes from other beginnings end,” - Seneca

As Seneca says in the quote:

Things begin. Things end. The end of one thing leads to the beginning of another.  As humans we need to keep our lives full. 

Full of family, full of friends, full of new challenges, full of enjoyable activities.

 

This is exactly what I got when I joined EMC (then DellEMC and Dell Technologies): I made a lot of friends and lived with many Teams that became my family over the Years.

I had a lot of fun in my tenure at EMC with different Teams: Performed crazy demos in front of thousands of people, spent hours on a command line in the Lab, burned the midnight oil to setup vLabs at conferences, recorded innumerable Power Hours (ie enablement for hundreds of people) sessions, performed impossible POCs, travelled crazy places in the world to make demanding Customers happy and spent infinite hours fighting over tech stuff over email/Slack or chat. I even _danced in a video_…..

Over these years I've been part of different Tribes (in the Seth Godin's definition) but in my hearth they have all been families. 

And now I am ready for a new challenge :)

I am joining Pivotal as a **Platform Architect** ([life of a platform architect](https://builttoadapt.io/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-pivotal-platform-architect-e7f823aae1bd)) covering the Alliance with Dell Technologies for EMEA.

The decision was long and well-tought-out (at least this is what my Mindmapping told me :P) but it boils down to three Things ([they had to be 3 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)):P):

* The company culture seems unique: they do what they preach at \*every\* level (Agile FTW)
* I love their technology but also their way of enabling Customers and I want to understand and practice them even more
* Many people that **I respect and trust** have joined them recently and they are super pumped about it

So I am starting my onboard right now (and BTW this is a Trello board: full of activities ranging from videos to labs and also HR stuff -> I told You that We execute the way We preach :P) and I am meeting multiple Customers in the next days: best way to get this started :)

I am pumped and humbled by the tech level of discussion that I see happening in our Slack. The level of collaboration and sharing is unbelievable :O

Let's get this started!!
