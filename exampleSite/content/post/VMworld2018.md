It's that time of the Year!!

Conferences, conferences and more conferences!!

VMworld US will be opening up at the end of August (holiday time for a lot of people in EMEA :P)

But still i wanted to capture e few of the sessions that I plan to attend (and I encourage You to meet me there!!), obviously they are all around DevOps, Kubernetes and Cloud Native Apps :P

I like Customer panels and this is the chance to see real life experiences coming from Customers. Mostly around Pivotal Container services but hey.. it's Kubernetes :)
