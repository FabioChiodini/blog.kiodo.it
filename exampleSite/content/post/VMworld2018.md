If you are installing Pivotal Container ServiceÂ® (PKS) more than once or if you need more automation for test environment **you can have it with PKS :)**

AS most of the interface is API based you just have to use some CLI abilities ;)

In my case I scavenged around for good scripts and I collected them [in one github repo](https://github.com/FabioChiodini/pks_scripts).

Here are some **notes on how to install the prerequisites** for the scripts.

# Powershell

if you are installing on Windows 2012 R2 [this a great guide](http://thesolving.com/virtualization/how-to-install-and-configure-vmware-powercli-version-10/).

BTW what I always forget is to allow all scripts

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Remember to **execute this as Administrator**

More paragraphs and links to come!!
