It's that time of the Year!!

Conferences, conferences and more conferences!!

VMworld US will be opening up at the end of August (holiday time for a lot of people in EMEA :P)

But still i wanted to capture e few of the sessions that I plan to attend (and I encourage You to meet me there!!), obviously they are all around DevOps, Kubernetes and Cloud Native Apps :P

## VMworld Sessions for Sunday

**What's New with PKS and Emerging Use Cases**

You should join this session just for Cornelia : she is amazing (and passionate about PKS!!) And as a bonus you'll get the latest on how with Vmware and pivotal you can make Kubernetes easy to consume

## VMworld Sessions for Monday

**Deploy Enterprise-Grade Kubernetes: Real-World Stories From PKS Customers**

CNA1199PU - 2 pm

I like Customer panels and this is the chance to see real life experiences coming from Customers. Mostly around Pivotal Container services but hey.. it's Kubernetes :)

## VMworld Sessions for Tuesday

**Put a Lid on It: Securing Containers and Kubernetes on vSphere**

CNA1656BU - 12.30 pm

Security can totally stop your Kubernetes deployment. In this talk we will see all the elements composing a Kubernetes infrastructure and how and when you should apply security best practices to it.

## VMworld Sessions for Wednesday

**Path to Production: Value Stream Mapping in a DevOps World**

DEV1325BU - 8.30 am

If you are up early (not easy in Vegas sometimes ;) You should join me here. We all love tech but putting Apps in production require people and processes. [Value Stream mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream_mapping) is amazing if you ask me. Join this session to get the basics and apply it in your enterprise ;)
